\chapter{RV12 Execution Pipeline}

The RV12 implements a 32/64bit Integer modified form of the classic RISC pipeline.
The pipeline consists of the Instruction Fetch, Pre-Decode, Instruction Decode, Execution, Memory Access, and Write Back stages as highlighted in the figure below.

\section{Instruction Fetch (IF)}\label{instruction-fetch-if}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics{assets/img/Pipeline-IF}
  \caption{Instruction Fetch Stage Implementation}
\end{figure}

The Instruction Fetch unit loads a new parcel from the program memory.
A parcel is a code field that contains one or more instructions.
The address of the parcel to load is held by the Program Counter (PC).
The Program Counter is either 32 or 64bits wide, depending on the XLEN parameter.
The Program Counter is updated whenever the Instruction Pipeline is not stalled.

If the pipeline is flushed the Program Counter is restarted from the given address.

\section{Pre-Decode (PD)}\label{pre-decode-pd}

The Pre-Decode unit translates 16-bit compressed instructions to the base 32bit RISC-V instructions and then processes Program Counter modifying instructions like Jump-And-Link and Branch.
This avoids waiting for the Execution stage to trigger the update and reduces the demand for pipeline flushes.
The destination address for branches is predicted based on the data provided by the optional Branch Prediction Unit or determined statically based on the offset.

\section{Instruction Decode (ID)}\label{instruction-decode-id-1}

The Instruction Decode unit ensures the operands for the execution units are available.
It accesses the Register File, calculates immediate values, sets bypasses, and checks for illegal opcodes and opcode combinations.

\section{Execute (EX)}\label{execute-ex-1}

The Execute stage performs the required operation on the data provided by the Instruction Decode stage.
The Execution stage has multiple execution units, each with a unique function.
The ALU performs logical and arithmetic operations.
The Multiplier unit calculates signed/unsigned multiplications.
The Divider unit calculates signed/unsigned division and remainder.
The Load-Store Unit accesses the data memory.
The Branch Unit calculates jump and branch addresses and validates the predicted branches.

Only one operation can be executed per clock cycle.
Most operations complete in one clock cycle, except for the divide instructions, which always take multiple clock cycles to complete.
The multiplier supports configurable latencies, to improve performance.

\section{Memory-Access (MEM)}\label{memory-access-mem-1}

The Memory Access stage waits for a memory read access to complete.
When memory is accessed, address, data, and control signals are calculated during the Execute stage.
The memory latches these signals and then performs the actual access. This means that read-data won't be available until 1 clock cycle later.
This would be at the end of the Write-Back stage, and hence too late. Therefore the Memory-Access stage is added.
