\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The RV12 is a highly configurable single-issue, single-core RV32I, RV64I
compliant RISC CPU intended for the embedded market. The RV12 is a
member of the Roa Logic's 32/64bit CPU family based on the industry
standard RISC-V instruction set.

The RV12 implements a Harvard architecture for simultaneous instruction
and data memory accesses. It features an optimizing folded 4-stage
pipeline, which optimizes overlaps between the execution and memory
accesses, thereby reducing stalls and improving efficiency.

Optional features include Branch Prediction, Instruction Cache, Data
Cache, Debug Unit and optional Multiplier/Divider Units. Parameterized
and configurable features include the instruction and data interfaces,
the branch-prediction-unit configuration, and the cache size,
associativity, replacement algorithms and multiplier latency. Providing
the user with trade offs between performance, power, and area to
optimize the core for the application.

RV12 is compliant with the RISC-V User Level ISA v2.2 and Privileged
Architecture v1.9.1 specifications published by the RISC-V Foundation
(https://riscv.org).
